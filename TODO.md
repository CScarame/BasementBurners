# Basement Burner's Records TODO List

## Site Logistics
    - Teach all players how to access and upload files on site
    - Teach all players how to download repository to their main device for easy access to all files
    - Write basic examples for all parts of the site for better understanding

## Info Folder
    - Create an **Info** folder, that has all of the meta information needed for someone to keep up with the campaign
    - A new or temporary player should be able to read through the Info folder and be able to create a character for a game session.

### To include in Info Folder
    - Campaign Summary - <1 page of info describing how we got to this point.
    - World Summary - Summary of differences between this world and your basic Forgotten realms style world
    - Added Game Rules - Any game rules that are not a part of the normal game rules, but are a part of our campaign
    - Session Schedule - A schedule of planned sessions, and perhaps a shareable calendar that can be updated to list details, participants, etc.
    - World Calendar - A retroactive calendar that tracks events that take place in the game world.  Not a shareable calendar because this calendar is way different
    - Guild Summary - A summary of how the guild fits into the game world, and how new characters can join it.
    
## Guild Plans
    -  The Basement Burners now own a large, uninteresting building, but much more goes into a guild than a building!  Players must decide how involved the guild will be.  Will the guild provide housing for the guild members?  What about food?  What about equipment?  Who owns the guild?  How will the guild make an income?  Will guild members be assigned jobs, or will they get to pick their assignments?  
    - A barren floor plan design will be uploaded.  As the guild changes over time we can draw in all of the changes that you plan to make in this floor plan.  Keep in mind that all of the things you put into the guild hall will have to come from somewhere, and will probably cost you.  
    - As more characters join the guild, you will need to find someone to deal with the day to day happenings of the guild, etc.  Or we can sorta gloss over it if it isn't fun
    
## Character Design Ideas
    - If you want to add a new character to our game, start thinking now!  If the character is going to be part of a new race start talking to me now so we can figure out their origin etc.  Start designing your **level 3** character sheet as well.
    
## Import current character sheets
    - All players should import their current character sheets
 
## Create character level-up quests
    - I'm going to talk to everyone about their character level up quests and how they're going to happen.
