## About

Tellius Gabbro is the Lord Mayor of Orinthal.  He rules the city through respect and hard work.  He may be getting old, but he is consistantly re-elected by the nobility for his skill in leading.

During the Festival of Fire, Lord Tellius was attacked by Maaria Vesti, who attempted to murder him.  The Basement Burners successfully saved Tellius here.
