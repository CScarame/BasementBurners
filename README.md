# Basement Burners Records

## Introduction

This is the Basement Burners Library.  Anything you need to know about the Burners, you can find here.  Over time this place will fill with records of the world, and of the people who inhabit it.  For now it's a bit empty, but that's okay.  First of all, I'm sure you're wondering how to use this library.  There's some complicated magic in place to make sure no one tampers with the library without permission.
